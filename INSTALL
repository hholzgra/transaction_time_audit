This is a MySQL plugin library generetad using CodeGen_Mysql_Plugin 0.9.3dev
To build the library configure it with:

    ./configure --with-mysql-src=... [--libdir=...]
    make
    sudo make install

You need to specify where to find the MySQL source for the server
you are running, this plugin library depends on server internals
not found in the public header files.

With --libdir=... you can specify your MySQL servers plugin_dir path.
As this is a runtime configuration setting in the server the configure
script is not reliably able to detect where it is so you should set
it manually.

If there is no 'configure' file yet you may need to generate it using

  autoreconf -i


To register the actual plugins within this library 
execute the following SQL statements:

    INSTALL PLUGIN `audit` SONAME 'audit.so';

To unregister the plugins execute

    FLUSH TABLES;   /* to make sure plugins are no longer referenced */
    UNINSTALL PLUGIN `audit`;


To test the plugin before installing it you need to make sure that the
following binaries and scripts are available via your $PATH:

 * mysql
 * mysql_install_db
 * mysqladmin 
 * mysqltest
 * mysqld

If you are using a binary tarball distribution or installed from source
yourself without changing the install prefix you can arrange for that 
using:

    PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/mysql/libexec:$PATH
    export PATH

You can then test the plugin using a simple

    make test
